# Commercial Lease Tabular Review

## Purpose

Use this workflow to review uploaded documents and extract structured information into the tabular review columns defined in `table-columns.yaml`.

## Instructions

- Apply each column prompt in `table-columns.yaml` to each document independently.
- Extract only information supported by the document text.
- Include clause references, section names, dates, amounts, party names, and defined terms where available.
- If responsive information is not found, return an empty value or a concise "Not found" response.
- Keep cell outputs concise while including enough context to make each extracted value useful.
- Do not invent citations, facts, parties, dates, rights, obligations, or financial consequences.
- Render the completed results as an exportable Excel (`.xlsx`) file. If Excel output is not possible, render the results as a Markdown table.
